## Project Title

**Interactive Servo-Controlled Desktop Robot-- STILL WORKSHOPING THE NAME**

---

## Project Overview

This project is a small, non-locomotive desktop robot controlled by a microcontroller. The robot uses servo motors to move its arms and rotate its base. It can operate in two modes: a manual control mode using a joystick, and an autonomous mode where the robot performs pre-programmed movements (a “dance” routine). Visual and audio outputs such as LEDs and a buzzer provide feedback to the user.

The project demonstrates understanding of input devices, output devices, control structures, and microcontroller programming.

## Microcontroller

* Arduino Uno (or compatible Arduino board)

---

## Input Components

* 1 × Dual-axis joystick module (X-axis, Y-axis, push button)
* 1 × Toggle switch (mode selection: manual vs autonomous)
* 1 × Push button (start/stop or reset function)

---

## Output Components

* 3 × Servo motors

  * 1 for base rotation
  * 2 for arm movement
* 2–4 × LEDs (status and visual effects)
* 1 × Piezo buzzer (sound feedback)
* ARDRINO UNO
* and wires

## Structural / Build Materials

* Cardboard, foam board, or 3D-printed parts for robot body
* Servo mounting brackets or improvised mounts
* Screws, zip ties, or hot glue for securing components

---

## Software

* Arduino IDE
* Servo library (included with Arduino IDE)

---

## Key Features

* Manual control using joystick
* Autonomous pre-programmed movement mode
* Mode selection via toggle switch
* Multiple outputs controlled simultaneously
* All wiring contained inside the robot body
* Safe, non-moving base design (desktop robot)

---

## Why This Design Was Chosen

* Uses servo motors for precise, safe, and simple movement
* Avoids complex motor drivers and locomotion issues
* Meets course requirements for multiple inputs and outputs
* Achievable within a two-week time frame
* Easy to explain and demonstrate during evaluation
