On this day, I refined and finalized my overall project plan to ensure it met the course requirements and rubric expectations. I confirmed the inputs and outputs that would be used and verified that the design was achievable within the given timeframe.

I also created a base platform to support the Arduino, breadboard, and wiring layout. This helped me plan how components would be mounted and how wiring could be kept organized and secure.

In addition, I began writing and testing basic Arduino code to ensure that the microcontroller could successfully compile and upload sketches. This initial code work helped confirm that the development environment was set up correctly and that the project could progress smoothly in later stages.
